## Features

* QWERTY layout
* 5 columns, 36 keys
* Home row mods
* French characters support with a single dead key and accent layer
* Mouse keys support (left/right clicks are good, scroll and movements still need a little work)
* Cursor/Scroll toggle with [Ploopy Nano Trackball](https://github.com/ploopyco/nano-trackball)
* Easy to read files, thanks to the [zmk-nodefree-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-nodefree-config) helper.

## Keymap

The keymap is made out of 6 layers:

1. QWERTY (DEF)
2. Accent (ACC)
3. Navigation (NAV)
4. Symbols (SYM)
5. Numbers (NUM)
6. Mouse (MOU)

For the exact layout, see the [corne.keymap](config/corne.keymap) file.
